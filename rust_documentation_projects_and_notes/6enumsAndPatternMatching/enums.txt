it's kinda hard to explain these, they're kinda like ... idk ... basically, an enum is a collection of related things, sorta like an interface maybe? mmm
honestly, just read the documentation if you forget

also, rust's version of null is an Option enum
here's the documentation
file:///home/ruby/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/std/option/enum.Option.html
sorta

... uhh, basically, use Option<T> when you don't know if your variable will have a value or be null
