    /*In languages with pointers, itâ€™s easy to erroneously create a dangling pointer, 
    a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, 
    by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory. 
    In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: 
        if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope 
        before the reference to the data does.
    
    to prevent this, just don't have functions that return references
