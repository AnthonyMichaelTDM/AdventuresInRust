//the first thing you do after initializing a new project with Cargo
//is to open and edit the Cargo.toml file, however, it'll probably be made for you,

//this function was generated for you by cargo
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
//all of the projects code should be in the /src directory 
//when cargo compiles code, it goes into the /target directory

//to compile this code with cargo, run
//cargo build
//in your terminal, then execute the binary generated

//if you want the code to be built and executed in one go, run
//cargo run 
//in your terminal

//if you want cargo to check your code without generating an executable, run
//cargo check
//in your terminal
