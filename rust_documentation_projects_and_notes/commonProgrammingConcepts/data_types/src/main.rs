    You can write integer literals in any of the forms below. 
      Note that all number literals except the byte literal allow a type suffix, 
      such as 57u8, and _ as a visual separator, such as 1_000.

    hex             | 0xff
    octal           | 0o77

    /*Rust‚Äôs char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, 
    which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. 
    Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; 
    emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. 
    Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. 
    However, a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a concept in Unicode, 
    so your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a char is in Rust. */



    ////// Compound types //////
    //Rust has 2 types of compound variable types, tuples and arrays

    ////the tuple type ////
    /*A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. 
    Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.*/
    /*We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. 
    Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don‚Äôt have to be the same.*/
    // We‚Äôve added optional type annotations in this example:
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    //To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:
    let (x,y,z) = tup;
    println!("{} _ {} _ {}", x,y,z);
    /*
    This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable tup. 
    It then uses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, x, y, and z. 
    This is called destructuring, because it breaks the single tuple into three parts.
    */
    /*
    In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, 
    we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. 
    For example:
    */
    let five_hundred = tup.0;
    let six_point_four = tup.1;
    let one = tup.2;
    println!("{} _ {} _ {}", five_hundred, six_point_four, one);

    //// the array type ////
    //Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
    //arrays have a fixed length
    //allocate data on the stack rather than the heap
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("{:?}",a);
    //vectors are like arrays, but can grow/shrink, more on those in later stuffs
    /*You would write an array‚Äôs type by using square brackets, 
    and within the brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:*/
    let arr: [i32; 5] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; //Here, i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.
    println!("{:?}",arr);
    /*if you want to create an array that contains the same value for each element, 
    you can specify the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:*/
    let a = [3; 5];
    println!("{:?}",a);
    /*The array named a will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially. 
    This is the same as writing let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]; but in a more concise way.*/
    //rust programs will crash if an out of index value is called
    println!("Please enter an array index.");
    let mut index = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    let index: usize = index.trim().parse().expect("Index entered was not a number");
    let element = arr[index];
    println!(
        "The value of the element at index {} is: {}",
        index, element
    );
