    /* REMOVING A CLONE USING AN ITERATOR:
    previously, this function looked like this:
    ```
    pub fn build(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {return Err("not enough arguments");}
        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();
        let case_sensitive = env::var("CASE_SENSITIVE").is_err();
        Ok(Config { query, filename, case_sensitive })    
    }
    ```

    At the time, we said not to worry about the inefficient `clone` calls because we would
    remove them in the future. Well, that time is now!

    Previously, we needed a `clone` here because we have a slice with `String` elements in the parameter `args`, 
    but the `build` function doesn't own `args`. 
    To return ownership of a `Config` instance, 
    we had to clone the values from the `query` and `filename` fields of `Config` so the `Config` instance can own its values.

    With our new knowledge about iterators, 
    we can change the `build` function to take ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of borrowing a slice. 
    Weâ€™ll use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length of the slice and indexes into specific locations. 
    This will clarify what the `Config::build` function is doing because the iterator will access the values.

    Once `Config::build` takes ownership of the iterator and stops using indexing operations that borrow, 
    we can move the `String` values from the iterator into `Config` rather than calling clone and making a new allocation.

    /*
     * USING THE RETURNED ITERATOR DIRECTLY
     * continued from main.rs
     * 
     * we've updated the signature of the `Config::build` function so the parameter `args` has a generic type with the trait bounds 'impl Iterator<Item = String>` instead of `&[String]`.
     * This usage of the `impl Trait` syntax is discussed in ch10, 
     * and means that `args` can be any type that implements the `Iterator` type and returns `String` items.
     * 
     * Because we're taking ownership of `args` and we'll be mutating `args` by iterating over it, we add the `mut` keyword into the specification of the `args` parameter to make it mutable.

        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }
    results
}
```
